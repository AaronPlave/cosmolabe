# cspice-wasm

A typed, promise-based API over CSPICE compiled to WebAssembly. It runs the SPICE
toolkit either in-process or in a Web Worker so the renderer and geometry layers
can query ephemerides, frames, and geometry events off the main thread. Core layer.

## Public API

Engine factories:

- `createSpiceEngine(options?)`: in-process engine (loads cspice.wasm directly); used by unit tests and as the worker entry point.
- `createSpiceWorkerClient(...)`: main-thread proxy that drives the engine in a Web Worker.
- `createSpiceWorkerPool(...)`: pool of worker clients for parallel sweeps.
- `installSpiceWorker`, `dispatchSpice`, `JobCancelledError`: the worker-side runtime.

Engine surface (`SpiceEngine` / `SpiceComputeEngine`):

- Kernels: `furnsh`, `unload`, `kclear`, `ktotal`.
- Time: `str2et`, `et2utc`, `utc2et`.
- Ephemeris: `spkpos`, `spkezr`, `spkposBatch` (zero-copy n*3 positions), `spkezrBatch` (zero-copy n*6 states plus light times, the batched-states primitive under the frames tier of ADR M-0002).
- Two-body math: `oscelt`, `conics`, `prop2b`; SPK Type 13 writeback via `writeSpkType13`.
- Geometry events: `gfoclt`, `gfdist`, `occult`.
- Frames and bodies: `pxform`, `sxform`, `bodvrd`, `bodvcd`, `getfov`.
- Surface and illumination: `sincpt`, `subpnt`, `ilumin`, `recgeo`, `et2lst`, `readDsk`.
- Attitude: `twovec`, `m2q`, `q2m`, `raxisa`.
- Spacecraft clock and CK attitude: `sce2c`/`sct2e` (ET <-> encoded SCLK ticks), `ckgp` (CK pointing query), and `writeCk03`, which writes a CK Type 3 segment (discrete quaternions plus optional angular rate, linear interpolation) and furnshes it so the attitude history is queryable through the same `pxform`/`ckgp` path. A class-3 frame (defined in an FK with `FRAME_<id>_CLASS=3`, `CK_<id>_SCLK`, `CK_<id>_SPK`) drives the scene orientation from a furnished C-kernel. See `ck.test.ts` for the write-then-read round trip and `scripts/make-fixture-ck.mjs` for the demo CK generator.
- Time series: `evalSeries` plus `runEvalSpec`, `gridEpochs`, `PROVIDER_CATALOG` for one-round-trip, cancellable sweeps over a grid.

Types include `Vec3`, `StateVector`, `PositionResult`, `CartesianState`, `OsculatingElements`, `AberrationCorrection`, `Mat3`, `StateBatchArrays`, and the located `SpiceError`. For in-process synchronous consumers (the frames tier, conformance rigs) the package also exports `SpiceBindings` and `createSpiceBindings`, the typed marshaling layer beneath the promise surface, including `namfrm` and `frmnam` for frame id resolution.

```ts
const engine = await createSpiceEngine();
await engine.furnsh('naif0012.tls', lskBytes);
await engine.furnsh('de440s.bsp', spkBytes);
const et = await engine.str2et('2004-07-01T00:00:00');
const { position, lightTime } = await engine.spkpos('6', et, 'J2000', 'NONE', '10');
```

## Dependency rule

Depends on nothing in the workspace. Part of the core layer; it never imports a PAL
implementation, UI, or shell. Kernel bytes are passed in by the caller (`furnsh(name, bytes)`),
so the engine never reads kernel files directly. `@bessel/spice` remains as a thin facade
re-exporting this package for bessel-heritage imports; the tier above it is
`@cosmolabe/frames` (ADR M-0002), and nothing above that tier calls this package directly.

## Tests

Tests live in `packages/cspice-wasm/src/*.test.ts` (spice, batch, dsk, geometry, geodetic,
occultation, propagation, eval-series, ck). The `ck.test.ts` round trip writes a known
attitude profile to a CK Type 3 segment, furnshes it, and asserts both `ckgp` and
`pxform(frame, J2000)` against the validated `q2m` quaternion convention. The acceptance
test (`spice.test.ts`) loads
`naif0012.tls` plus a de440s SPK and asserts `spkpos` of Saturn barycenter (6) relative
to the Sun (10) in J2000 at 2004-07-01 against a NAIF reference pinned from de440s,
agreeing well within 1 metre, and checks that unresolved bodies raise a typed `SpiceError`.

## Status / limitations

All calls are async even in-process. Geometry-event finders (`gfoclt`, `gfdist`)
require a search `step` shorter than the briefest event or they can miss intervals;
correctness follows CSPICE semantics.
